# Introduction to Sensors, Instrumentation, and Measurement (ISIM) Coursework

ISIM is a laboratory based first-year course at Olin College in which I built circuits and conducted experiments. My coursework included 10 problem sets, 9 lab reports, and one final project. Check out my [Ultrasonic Rangefinder Lab Report]("./BestAssignments/ISIM_Lab_Report_10_Ultrasonic.pdf").

-------------------------

The course goals are to:

- teach the basic concepts and skills related to building and analyzing analog circuits
- cover the fundamental concepts for circuit analysis
- follow the broader themes of making measurements, doing real experiments, and analyzing data
- emphasize making electronic measurements
  - Many measurements we make in science and engineering are through sensors, circuits, and computer-based data acquisition.
