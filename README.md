# Introduction to Sensors, Instrumentation, and Measurement (ISIM) Coursework

ISIM is a laboratory based first-year course at Olin College in which I built circuits and conducted experiments. My coursework included 10 problem sets, 9 lab reports, and one final project. Check out some of my favorite work from this class: 

- [Electrocardiogram](https://github.com/liloheinrich/ISIM/blob/main/Labs/Lab%205%20Electrocardiogram/EKG_ISIM_Lab_Report.pdf)
- [Blood Pressure measurement](https://github.com/liloheinrich/ISIM/blob/main/Labs/Lab%206%20Blood%20Pressure/BP_ISIM_Lab_Report.pdf)
- [Pulse Oximeter](https://github.com/liloheinrich/ISIM/blob/main/Labs/Lab%208%20Oximeter/Oximeter_ISIM_Lab_Report.pdf)
- [Ultrasonic Rangefinder Lab Report](https://github.com/liloheinrich/ISIM/blob/main/Labs/Lab%2010%20Ultrasonic/Ultrasonic_ISIM_Lab_Report.pdf)

-------------------------

The course goals are to:

- teach the basic concepts and skills related to building and analyzing analog circuits
- cover the fundamental concepts for circuit analysis
- follow the broader themes of making measurements, doing real experiments, and analyzing data
- emphasize making electronic measurements
  - In science and engineering, many measurements are made through sensors, circuits, and computer-based data acquisition.
